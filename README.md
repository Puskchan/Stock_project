# Real-Time News Sentiment Analysis and Stock Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict stock prices using real-time sentiment analysis on news articles. The data pipeline integrates news sentiment scores and historical stock prices, leveraging machine learning models to forecast stock market trends.

## Features

* Real-time sentiment analysis on news articles.
* Stock price prediction using time-series data.
* Data pipeline integration with Kafka for real-time data flow.
* Visualization through a dashboard using Streamlit or Gradio.
* Cloud-ready with Docker and Kubernetes.

## Technologies Used

* **Languages**: Python
* **APIs**: <https://www.newscatcherapi.com/>, Twitter (Tweepy), Yahoo_fin
* **Libraries**: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, `transformers`, `kafka-python`, `pymongo`, `mysql-connector-python`, `redis-py`
* **DevOps Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Kafka, Redis, Prometheus, Grafana
* **Machine Learning**: LSTM/GRU for stock prediction, BERT/VADER for sentiment analysis

## Setup Instructions


1. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Configure APIs**:
   * Register on [NewsCatcher API](https://newscatcherapi.com/) and Twitter to get API keys.
   * Set up environment variables for API keys.
3. **Kafka & Redis Setup**:
   * Install and configure Kafka for data streaming.
   * Set up Redis for caching.
4. **Data Acquisition**:
   * Fetch news and stock data using APIs.
   * Store in MongoDB or MySQL.
5. **Model Training**:
   * Preprocess data (clean news articles, normalize stock data).
   * Train sentiment analysis and stock prediction models.
   * Track experiments using MLflow or W&B.

## Running the Project


1. **Run Data Pipeline**:

   ```bash
   python data_pipeline.py
   ```
2. **Model Inference**:

   ```bash
   python model_inference.py
   ```
3. **Launch Dashboard**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```

## Deployment

* **Docker**:
  * Build and run Docker containers for each component.
* **Kubernetes (Optional)**:
  * Deploy containers using Kubernetes.
* **CI/CD**:
  * Set up automated deployment using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.

## Monitoring & Maintenance

* Monitor system performance using Prometheus and Grafana.
* Set up alerts for failures and performance degradation.
